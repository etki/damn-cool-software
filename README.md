# Damn Cool Software

## Where am i?

This is a repository about cool pieces of software i meet on the 
internet, named after [Damn Cool Algorithms][] article series.

The amount of cool software is, erm, overwhelming, so i have difficult 
times remembering "databases with PN-Counter type" or "that cli utility
that would let me render anything". Because of that i decided to create
a specific repo just for keeping up an index of software i'm using or 
would love to use.

The details of internal schema are yet to come; pull-requests are 
welcome for the dev branch.
